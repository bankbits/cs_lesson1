A CS lesson for learning C programming
This code is meant to demonstrate how to work with files, bitmaps and pointers
The idea is for the student to take this code as a starting point and enhance it.
To compile and run the program type at the command line:

make
./cs1

It will create a file in the current directory called test.bmp. This file
and its data was created entirely in C code. A good next step would be to create
a 32-bpp color image instead of the 1-bpp image provided.
