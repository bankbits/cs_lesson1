A CS lesson for learning C programming
This code is meant to demonstrate how to work with pointers and different
native data types. It allocates memory for 2 arrays and fills one with
a set of integer values. The program has several errors and warnings which
prevent it from working properly. The challenge of this lesson is to
fix the errors so that the program works correctly.

To compile and run the program type at the command line:

make
./cs1
